You've seen the simple linear regression using ordinary least squares, and its more general regression of polynomial functions. You've also seen how we can overfit models to data using polynomials and interactions. With all of that, you began to explore other tools to analyze this general problem of overfitting versus underfitting, all this using training and test splits, bias and variance, and cross validation.\n",

Some of the penalties have the property of performing both variable selection (setting some coefficients exactly equal to zero) and shrinking the other coefficients. Ridge and Lasso regression are two examples of penalized estimation. There are multiple advantages to using these methods:\n",

    "An important step before using either Lasso or Ridge regularization is to first standardize your data such that it is all on the same scale. Regularization is based on the concept of penalizing larger coefficients, so if you have features that are on different scales, some will get unfairly penalized. Below, you can see that we are using a `MinMaxScaler` to standardize our data to the same scale. A downside of standardization is that the value of the coefficients become less interpretable and must be transformed back to their original scale if you want to interpret how a one unit change in a feature impacts the target variable."
